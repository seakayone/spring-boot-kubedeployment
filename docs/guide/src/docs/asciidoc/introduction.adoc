Sample project demonstrating how local development with a local Kubernetes cluster could look like.

Used technologies:

* Spring Boot for the `backend` project server implementation
* Gradle as the build tool
* Some kordamp gradle plugins for ease of handling multiproject builds and documentation
* The gradle plugin jib as the docker image build tool
* Command line tool skaffold as the glue to deploy the docker container to a local kubernetes cluster
